As you reach the third floor, are immediately greeted by
a friendly-looking elf wearing a green hat and a red overcoat.
He has a rucksack full of presents and is holding
a big candy cholocate bar in his left hand.
He seems confused to see you here all alone
on the afternoon of the Christmas celebration,
but he engages in seemingly cheerful conversation nonetheless.
#

Y: "He knows what's coming, he's played the other routes already!"
the elf suddenly yelps screechingly, shouting for help from others.
This alls seems to have been a giant Christmas-themed trap!

#

N: "That's great, that's copacetic", the elf exclaims.
He seems to be happy with your answer. You gulp and hope for the best.
#

Y: "Oh you have, then! Then you probably know better
how to get those if you want them that bad!" he says and
immediately shouts for help.

It seems that other will want to follow his fighting with you,
so you better engage fast!

                    FIGHT WITH EVIL ELF (LEVEL 7)

#

You've won again! The elf lies on the floor, trying to say something.
You read his lips.

"Stop him! Not the... green-colored button! Everything but!"

he apparently spits out. You give him a nod for a helpful tip,
unsure of the tip's helpfulness in the great scheme of things.
Terrified of what's in store for you now, you proceed forward.
#

N: "I'm just strolling through, window-shopping and such",
you explain, hoping your bad acting skills won't make this worse.
The elf freezes for a second, then smiles happily and
takes the escalator back down.
You probably lie this greatly to everyone in your life too, do you?

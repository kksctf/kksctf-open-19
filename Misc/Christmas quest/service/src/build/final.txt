Here it is! You enter a what looks to be an abandoned food court with
all types of your favorite fast food restaurant chain brands' names
plastered on the walls. There is a stupendous Christmas tree,
adorned in a garland spelling out "MERRY CHRISTMAS",
in the middle of the court that seems quite lonely
in the absense of absolutely everyone.

You approach with extreme carefulness and prepare yourself for the
final fight, ready to find out the mystery behind this creepy mall.
#

As you expected, there's slow moving with branch crackling...
The collosus tree towers over you, ready to strike!
#

                    FIGHT WITH XMAS TREE (LEVEL 8)

#

The Christmas tree is no longer a threat, but at the very last second,
a fully-clothed Santa appears from behind it,
ready to help out his yet another evil minion.
#

"It seems like you are ready to put a stop to my
Christmas-ending programme!" Santa says. He huffs and puffs, is angry
and frustrated, and he has a reason for it, he explains to you.
He goes on to tell you about his grand plans to halt
the Christmas tradition and leave everyone enjoy a more bland,
lifeless holidays on the Christmas eve because of his grown tiredness
of the same old spiel for years and years. He's thinking of
starting out slow, with your town's mall in the beginning,
and then pursuing a worldwide crisis altogether.
#

"But enough talk!" he finally says, growing tired of explaining
his motivations to you. "You're nothing more than a regular cog
in the consumerist Christmas machine, after all!"
It's not like you can put an end to this... or can you?
#

                      FIGHT WITH SANTA (LEVEL 10)

#

Santa's on his knees know, feeling unhealthy and ready to
accept his failure. He doesn't seem too down, though, and
it looks like his plan is still in action:
the walls begin to crumble as if you were
witnessing an eathquake yourself.
#

"Hahaha, you won't escape! Use the remote controller if you dare,
but it's not like you'll know what to do with it!
And simply guessing won't do the trick!"
Santa shrieks while lying on the floor.
You suddenly remember about the remote and
reach to your pocket for it.
#

Two buttons, a green and a purple one, are on the front panel.
You're faced with a choice more impactful then picking a burger
to munch after a tiring homework session!
#

Which button are you willing to pick, the green or the purple one?
#

GREEN: Time stands still for what feels like an eternity.
You--slowly--turn your head around, ready for anything,
as you see the floow melting away under your feet,
and you realize you're flying through the air outside.
It seems that you've activated a self-destruction feature of sorts,
which in turn commenced an option for destroying the Christmall mall
and Santa's wicked plan to stop Christmas with it!

However, you feel uncertain if the choice you made
was really the correct one. Were you actually paying attention to
the clues around you, or were stuck in a scheme arranged
disadvantageously against you with in a
no-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel kind of deal?

It seems that you've reached the end of your journey, but
before the police gets here,
you climb out of the snow you've landed into and head home.
#

PURPLE: Time stands still for what feels like an eternity.
The Santa looks around and starts counting out loud.
"One! Two! Three!" he shouts, despare clinging in the air.
He looks exhausted, he looks like something has failed him!
You realize you've foiled his plans, defeating him spectacularly
in the process, and you rush past him
into the back room of the food court.

What you see in front of you is a sight to behold.

A room filled to the brim with presents of all sizes,
this was the hoarding place of the evil mastermind himself.
You notice a phone on the wall, dial the police and
decide to get out as soon as possible. Leaving the room
on your way to the emergency stairs
while grabbing a bunch of expansive-looking presents,
you notice a golden envelope on one of the boxes.

This seems like something very important, so you take it and
rush downstairs, to finally escape to the outside world.

It's freezing outside, you hear police cars glaring in the distance
and you decide to tear the envelope to see a piece of paper inside
with a single line on it.

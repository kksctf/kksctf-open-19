You go through the turnstile and decide to visit
one of the empty cafe shops on the side. You're unexpectedly
ambushed by a staff member that's apparently alive!
He starts chucking numerous heavy-looking presents into you,
but you dodge out of the way, getting ready for a battle.
Not the first-grade service one could've expected,
but at least he's smiling in the process!

                   FIGHT WITH SHOP ACCOUNTANT (LEVEL 3)

#

Similar to the snowman, the accountant blows up into little pieces!
This was a robot plot set up specifically to combat
any intruders trying to get inside.
Good thing you're the best at rolling dice!
You proceed forward and see a step ladder leading somewhere up above.
You get on it and climb upwards, finding yourself on the second floor.

#

You stopped to catch a break when suddenly,
a giant realistic-looking toy reindeer jumps through
the window of a nearby shop and lands before you!

You decide to encounter the reindeer, but win without severe violence.

                        FIGHT WITH REINDEER (LEVEL 4)

#

You've won fair and square, and the raindeer seems to accept that.
It does seem exceptionally cute, and as you take a gander at
his royal silky fur, you see a note stickied to his back!

It cryptically says, "The purple is the key."
What could this mean and how does one understand
the message behind this?
#

You march forward a bit and see two ways to proceed:

an escalator upwards and

a door with a ladder icon painted over it.

You close the door behind you and climb the neverending stairs up.
Actually, it's about thirty actual steps,
it's just that they are way tall then the average ones,
almost as if they were constructed for someone
giant and ogre-like, something stronger and much bigger than you.
#

As you reach the end, something bonks you on the head.
A medium-sized box wrapped in Christmas paper
is now on the upper step in front of you,
but as you extend your hand toward it,
a papier-mache hand dangles from the inside of the box,
ready to slap you anytime! I guess this is the fight, huh?

#

The box seems quiet now, having lost all of its HP pool.
But you're still scared of even looking
in the evil box's general direction!
#

An adventurous, Lara Croftian part of you,
the one that's all about spelunking and
staying late night to watch horror movies,
wants you to closely search the box and everything around it.

But the other easily-spooked, Lovecraftian part of you
wants to just skip ahead to the upcoming bits!

#

Y: You realize this was a bad choice the moment you approach the box.
You unwrap it to meet the most horrifying,
the most Stiven King-like creature known to man:
an unwrapped gift box that pretended to be a mimic!

N: You dodge out of the way with the grace of a doe,
or if we were to make this simile more down-to-Earth,
with the grace of a university student ducking away after
noticing the professor of a course you've skipped
way too many seminars of lately! wowwhatagreatjoke.jpg
#

You proceed forward.

Before the upcoming Christmas Eve, you approach the Christmas mall.
There are a lot of evil critters inside who are starving for blood
of those unwise souls who came here in the search of cheap gifts 
on the Christmas Eve. The townsfolk say that the one who manages to
break through all the trials and escape (relatively) unscathed
will get an ultimate reward.

Are you brave enough to enter the mall?
#

N: A wise decision, stranger. Your mom will do just fine without
that expensive silverware for a Christmas present.
You turn around and get the heck away from there.
#

Y: You proceed at your own risk.
#

In front of the mall's entrance, you see
a suspiciously looking snowman. Once you get closer...  
#

The snow crumbles away as you encounter a robotic snowman
hidden behind the snowy facade. His body is made of metallic armor,
eyes shining blue--a mecha-snowman of sorts?

He mutters something indistinguishable and faces you...
#

"Hold on right there", you think to yourself
as you hear your phone ring. The snowman will have to wait.
You've got a message from an unknown sender,
a text you would be willing to disregard
as another run-of-the-mill useless spam--and yet,
the contents have allegedly a lot to do with
what is about to occur here.

This serves as a great introduction to the following proceedings,
but now's possibly the time for some on-hands experience.

                FIGHT WITH EVIL SNOWMAN (LEVEL 1)

#

With your last pound, the violent kerfuffle has come to end.
The snowman's shiny metallic head explodes,
leaving a strange remote controller.
The device seems to be made out of cheap plastic
and has two buttons plastered over it, a green and a purple one.

Confused by what just happened,
you seem determined to continue anyway.

#
As you enter the Christmal mall, you're greeted with
lavish insides of a busy place. There's something creepy
about the ambience, though--there's absolutely no one you can see
in your vicinity whatsoever! It feels as empty as a classroom
on the 31 of December. You notice two apparent ways
to progress inside,

a dusty ELEVATOR to the right
with a glowing green button on the wall nearby, and

a TURNSTILE right in front of you.
